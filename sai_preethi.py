"""**Reasoning**:
The error `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'current' where it is not associated with a value` indicates that the variable `current` is being used in the calculation of `current` within the `solar_panel_model` function before it has been assigned a value. This is because the equation is implicit and cannot be solved directly in this manner. Additionally, there was a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in exp` in the `solar_panel_model` function. To fix this, the `solar_panel_model` function needs to be redefined to correctly calculate the current for a given voltage, irradiance, and temperature. A common approach for the implicit equation is to use a numerical solver, or to rearrange the equation to solve for current iteratively. Since the previous step was just defining the model, and the current subtask is to iterate and collect results, the fix needs to be in the model definition itself, which was done in a previous step. However, since the error occurred when calling the model, I need to provide the corrected model definition again. I will use a simplified, explicit formula that avoids the implicit calculation, similar to the last attempt in the previous model definition step, but ensuring it is correct. I will also address the potential overflow by checking the arguments to `np.exp`.

### Subtask:
Analyze the simulation results to observe how irradiance and temperature affect the panel's performance and maximum power point. Summarize the findings.

## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   Increasing solar irradiance significantly increases the short-circuit current (Isc) and the maximum power output, with a smaller increase in the open-circuit voltage (Voc).
*   Increasing temperature slightly increases the short-circuit current (Isc) but significantly decreases the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the maximum power output.
*   The maximum power point (MPP) shifts towards higher current and power with increasing irradiance.
*   The maximum power point (MPP) shifts towards lower voltage and power with increasing temperature.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The simplified single-diode model provides a good approximation for demonstrating the general V-I and P-V characteristics and the impact of irradiance and temperature.
*   For more accurate simulations in renewable energy system design, a more rigorous single-diode model requiring iterative numerical solutions or a more complex multi-diode model would be beneficial.
